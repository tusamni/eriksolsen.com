            I'm more than a bit embarassed to say I've lived in Austin for years and never made it out to COTA. That all changed with an invite to the 2017 US Vintage Nationals. It was awesome to walk around
            the pits and see vintage F-1 cars idling and pit crews working fervently to get everything up and running.
