## Scheduling Conflicts

PCA of Austin has been trying to host an event at a friend's Porsche collection and shop for years. However, COVID and other issues pushed it back several times. Finally, the stars aligned and the event was held on <a href="https://hcrpca.org/event/john-patterson-collection-tech-session" title="PCA Event in Austin">June 12th, 2021</a>.

## Back on Schedule

After a spirited Hill Country drive, PCA members were invited over for a tour of the collection and shop, as well as food provided by <a href="https://www.crepecrazy.com" title="Crepe Crazy">Crepe Crazy</a>.

Lots of great Porsches inside (of course) and outside the shop. 964's, early 911's and later GT3's, good representation all around.
