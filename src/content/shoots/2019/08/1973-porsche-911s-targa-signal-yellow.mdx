### Signal Yellow

A friend decided to list this gorgeous 911S Targa. It was a car owned by a well known member of the early Porsche community who sadly passed away. My friend was able to purchase this car from his estate with the intention on finishing the car to the standars of the previous owner.

What's not to love about this car: Pepita houndstooth and tan leather interior, targa, "S" and finished in Signal Yellow from the factory. It's an amazing assortment of options, one of my favorite cars in his collection.

This car finally made it to [auction years later](/photography/shoots/2023/06/1973-porsche-911s-targa). We knew it would do well, but it exceeded expectations fetching $268,000. However, this car is worth every penny. It's a wonderful spec and build. Just look at the interior!
