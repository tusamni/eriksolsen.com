### Humvee H1

I love the red Humvee. I believe it's owned and modified by Mungle Bros Garage in Dripping Springs. I've always wanted to own an H1, but I'd have to assume it would get old really fast.

### Impala

I'm not an classic American car guru, but the Gold Impala really spoke to me. I'd probably opt for a different set of wheels, but that front end just looks classicly bad-ass.

A big thanks to Treaty Oak for hosting this show every year. If you're in Dripping Springs swing by, grab a drink and have some lunch, their property is beautiful.
