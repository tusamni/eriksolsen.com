    ## Demon in the Details

    There were plenty of interesting cars there, but this was right around the time of the Demon release. I was just blown away with how ridiculous this car was. I can't even imagine trying to put down 800hp on the street, even with road legal slicks.

    The demon really is in all the details. It's a single purpose car and Dodge makes no bones about it. I'm in love.
