                    ## European Collectibles

                    European Collectibles is such a beautiful shop and they've always got great vehicles to show off. I really liked the black early 911S. I don't know that I've ever seen one in black, and it's quite striking.

            Tucked away in an industrial park alleyway, you'll find Son of Cobra. They're a manufacturer of surfboards and 2002 BMW carbon fiber parts. To show off their chops, they had a seafoam green BMW 2002 on display with their full array of carbon parts. Their attention to detail is off the charts.
