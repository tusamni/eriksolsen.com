### Race History

This Bahia red 911S was long term owned by an SCCA racer. Tons of history and documents made this a very special car, like the photos from 1980 of it racing in various SCCA events.

The car had obvious wear and tear, but it drove beautifully for the shoot and sounded absolutely awesome with the modified exhaust. These cars are becoming increasingly rare to find in good shape, and this one was worth every bit of the $143,000 hammer price.

I hope the new owner continues the tradition of racing this car in the future.
