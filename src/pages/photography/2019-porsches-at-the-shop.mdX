Armed with my new [Sony Zeiss 55mm f/1.8 and a Sony Zeiss 16-35mm f/4](/blog/car-photography-update), I header over to a friend's shop.

Up to this point I had been shooting with a 35mm Sony Zeiss f/2.8. I love that little lens, but it's not a great all around car photography lens. Since I wanted to continue the Sony Zeiss theme, I snagged their 16-35mm and 55mm. I figured the 55mm would give me a little longer reach.

In hindsight, it wasn't enough. I really needed another lens around the 85-100mm mark. But the Sony Zeiss series will always hold a special place in my heart.
