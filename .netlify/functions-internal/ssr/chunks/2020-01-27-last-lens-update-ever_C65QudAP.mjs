That's a great piece of advice I could have used a long time ago, but I'm hoping that I've finally settled for the best, all-around lens setup for my style of photography.\r\n\r\nOver the last three years I've had two bodies, but owned eleven different lenses. I've even owned some of them twice, I'm not a smart man. So allow me to impart some wisdom on anyone reading this. **Rent your lenses!**\r\n\r\nLuckily for me, my lenses held their value pretty well, so I didn't spend a fortune trying to figure out what I liked. But it 100% would have been cheaper for me to rent the few times a year I was doing large shoots to figure out what I liked.\r\n\r\n<Figure src=\"shoots/2020/2020-02-29-lit-show-day-three/lit-show-2020_002.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n## Size Matters\r\n\r\nIn the end, I shoot cars. That means I'm traveling to my destination. As much as I fell in love with the Sigma ART line, I just can't justify carrying those behemoths around. Not to mention I started using a Zhiyun Weebill-S gimbal and the 50mm Sigma f/1.4 pushes it's motors to the limits.\r\n\r\n<Figure src=\"shoots/2020/2020-02-29-lit-show-day-three/lit-show-2020_037.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n## The Finale\r\n\r\nIn the end, I had to ask myself what was most important. I came up with two requirements:\r\n\r\n-   Had to be a reasonable size and weight\r\n-   Had to have a consistent photo style across the lineup\r\n\r\nIn the end, the Zeiss Batis lineup was the best fit. They're small-ish, relatively lightweight with great build quality. Also, whether I'm shooting interiors with the 18mm or exteriors with the 85mm, every photo will have a consistent look and feel.\r\n\r\n### Final Setup\r\n\r\n-   Sony A7iii\r\n-   Zeiss Batis 18mm f/2.8\r\n-   Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2.0\r\n-   Zeiss Batis 40mm f/2.0\r\n-   Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8\r\n";
