    long: Erik's professionalism and expertise were on display from our first interaction onward. He was responsive and flexible while we planned the photo shoot. When it came time to shoot, Erik followed the shot list closely and went above and beyond with additional photos of my vehicle. After shooting, Erik promptly made the necessary edits and shared the photos. Hiring Erik positioned me to sell my vehicle at top dollar compared to the market average; I highly recommend him!
