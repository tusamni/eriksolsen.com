The owner invited me out to his beautiful, sprawling ranch home in Bulverde, TX to shoot his long-owned 1966 Jaguar Type-E. He had endless entertaining stories after owning this car for decades. Obviously a well-loved and cared for car, the new owner won't be disappointed.

It was a joy to shoot and made me appreciate early British styling and engineering. I'd love to drive a a Series 3 E-Type with the V12 someday, but the smaller inline-6 keeps the early E-Types nimble and rev-happy.
