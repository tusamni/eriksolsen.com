### Red & White

I've been toying around with lenses. I had been seeing a lot of photos shot with the Sigma Art lineup and they piqued my interest. I lucked into a 50mm Sigma Art f/1.4. I instantly fell in love with the sharpness. I still think the Zeiss Batis lineup has a more pleasing look, but nothing compares to the Art sharpness.

The white 1974 Porsche 911 is stunning on cookie cutter wheels. It was a Car and Driver magazine featured car and [recently sold on Bring a Trailer](/photography/shoots/2023/09/1974-porsche-911-coupe) for $80,000.

The red car is a Porsche 912 with a flat-six engine swap from a Porsche 911. The custom decals are amazing.
