I've confessed before that I'm not well versed on classic American cars. I do have fond memories of driving a 1956 Chevrolet Del Ray in high school. That said, this Impala SS in a lovely blue mixed with a high-contrast, cloudy day looked great!

I think the best angle is the rear quarter shot. The three-wide tail light arrangment and long Chevrolet badge fit so well.
