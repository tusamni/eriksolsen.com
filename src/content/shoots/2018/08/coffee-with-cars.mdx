## Demon in the Details

Each month, Greater Goods Coffee in Dripping Springs hosts Coffee With Cars.

While there were plenty of interesting cars there, the Dodge Demon really caught my eye. I was just blown away with how ridiculous this car was. I can't even imagine trying to put down 800hp on the street, even with road legal slicks.

The demon really is in all the details. It's a single purpose car and Dodge makes no bones about it. I'm in love.
