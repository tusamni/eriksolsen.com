## Back to Batis

There's a common saying in the photography world, "Marry your lenses, date your camera". That's a great piece of advice I could have used a long time ago, but I'm hoping that I've finally settled for the best, all-around lens setup for my style of photography.

Over the last three years I've had two bodies, but owned eleven different lenses. I've even owned some of them twice, I'm not a smart man. So allow me to impart some wisdom on anyone reading this. **Rent your lenses!**

Luckily for me, my lenses held their value pretty well, so I didn't spend a fortune trying to figure out what I liked. But it 100% would have been cheaper for me to rent the few times a year I was doing large shoots to figure out what I liked.

## Size Matters

In the end, I shoot cars. That means I'm traveling to my destination. As much as I fell in love with the Sigma ART line, I just can't justify carrying those behemoths around. Not to mention I started using a Zhiyun Weebill-S gimbal and the 50mm Sigma f/1.4 pushes it's motors to the limits.

## The Finale

In the end, I had to ask myself what was most important. I came up with two requirements:

- Had to be a reasonable size and weight
- Had to have a consistent photo style across the lineup

In the end, the Zeiss Batis lineup was the best fit. They're small-ish, relatively lightweight with great build quality. Also, whether I'm shooting interiors with the 18mm or exteriors with the 85mm, every photo will have a consistent look and feel.
