I'm more than a bit embarassed to say I've lived in Austin for years and never made it out to COTA. That all changed with an invite to the 2017 US Vintage Nationals.

According to [SVRA](https://svra.com/events/2020-us-vintage-national-championship/), Vintage Nationals

> invites all vintage racers to experience this world-class facility during its U.S. Vintage National Championship â€”grab some sprint race points and/or win a coveted Golden Bell Championship helmet.

It was awesome to walk around the pits and see vintage F-1 cars idling and pit crews working fervently to get everything up and running.
