It was a light showing so I only snapped two photos. The 240SX made with green with envy, I've always wanted an RB swapped Nissan.\r\n\r\nAfter the show I went to a friend's Porsche shop to shoot a few quick photos. I love the look of the Blue 912 photo, it makes the car almost look like a toy.\r\n\r\n<Gallery>\r\n    <Grid>\r\n        {frontmatter.gallery.map((i) => (\r\n            <GridImage>\r\n                <Picture src={i} />\r\n            </GridImage>\r\n        ))}\r\n    </Grid>\r\n</Gallery>\r\n\r\n";
