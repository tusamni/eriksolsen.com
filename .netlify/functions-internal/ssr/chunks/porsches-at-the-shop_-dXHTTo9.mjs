I love that little lens, but it's not a great all around car photography lens. Since I wanted to continue the Sony Zeiss theme, I snagged their 16-35mm and 55mm. I figured the 55mm would give me a little longer reach.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, it wasn't enough. I really needed another lens around the 85-100mm mark. But the Sony Zeiss series will always hold a special place in my heart.\r\n\r\n<Gallery>\r\n    <Grid>\r\n        {frontmatter.gallery.map((i) => (\r\n            <GridImage>\r\n                <Picture src={i} />\r\n            </GridImage>\r\n        ))}\r\n    </Grid>\r\n</Gallery>\r\n\r\n";
