### LIT Show Swap Meet and Car Show

The final day of our trip always culminates with the Porsche swap meet and car show. I always enjoy shooting a Singer. It's almost too easy, every inch is perfection. You know the show is excellent when there is a Porsche 959 parked in the rear of the lawn.

### Bruce Meyer

As great as the swap meet and show was, nothing can top the last leg of our journey. Usually we do the Petersen Museum. However, this year, we were able to get a private tour of Bruce Meyer's collection. I won't go into all the details, but it's such a wonderful collection of automotive history. Bruce is absolutely genuine. If you ever read this Bruce, thanks again, it was an experience I'll never forget!
