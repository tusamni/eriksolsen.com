  "I think I've got a serious case of FOMO (fear of missing out) when it comes to full frame. I haven't reached the capabilities of my Sony A6000, but I still can't shake the feeling that I'd be getting more out of a full frame A7. I'm sure that's a bad justification, but I'm going with it.";

## Full Frame Upgrade

For the last three years I've been using a Sony A6000 with a 16-50mm kit lens. It's been a good camera, _actually it's been great_. I shouldn't have any complaints, right?

Due to my tech addiction, I've got the itch to go full frame. So I've decided to sell it. My justification is that I've never had a full frame camera before, and frankly the APC-C lens selection for the Sony's right now is pretty weak. There are far greater options for the full frame Sony's.

So Amazon is currently in the process of delivering:

- Sony A7ii
- Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2
- Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8

I'll try to keep this list updated as much as possible. I have a bad habit of trading and upgrading gear a lot. I'm slowly learning that my skills are quickly falling behind the capabilities of my equipment.
