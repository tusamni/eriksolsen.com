## Inside Shoot

A friend was lucky enough to snag this out of control, "paint-to-sample" purple 911SC from the original owner. Her story is awesome. She literally walked across the street from a Porsche dealer, bought a felt, purple pen from a Hobby Lobby, gave it to the salesmen, and said, "I want it that color".

He's now in possession of the car and the pen!

I was able to tag along for a magazine shoot to feature the car. Most of the interior shots are dark as I wasn't in control of the lighting. It was neat to watch another photographer work, minus the 100 degree Texas weather inside a giant metal box.
