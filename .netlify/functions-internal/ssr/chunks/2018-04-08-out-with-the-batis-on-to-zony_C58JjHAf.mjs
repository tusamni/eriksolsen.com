Great camera and lens combo, but for some reason I'm finding the itch to go smaller.\r\n\r\nI've decided to downgrade (?) to a Zeiss Sonnar T\\* 35mm f/2.8. The form factor just can't be beat. I think that I'll be more apt to shoot if I'm not stuck carrying around a few primes. The Zony 35mm still has that Zeiss image and build quality, so I'm hopeful it won't feel like a \"downgrade\".\r\n\r\n<Figure src=\"shoots/2018/2018-05-08-ice-metallic-green-930/porsche-930-2018_008.jpg\" />\r\n";
