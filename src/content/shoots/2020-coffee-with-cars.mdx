## Blue Bug

Another trip to the Hill Country for Coffee With Cars at Greater Goods Coffee. It was a light showing so I only snapped two photos. The 240SX made with green with envy, I've always wanted an RB swapped Nissan.

After the show I went to a friend's Porsche shop to shoot a few quick photos. I love the look of the Blue 912 photo, it makes the car almost look like a toy.
