                    <h2>Cameras</h2>
                    <p>
                        First let's talk camera bodies for car photography&hellip;they're meaningless. If you're only concerned with photography, the camera body really doesn't matter, especially if you're only shooting digital and won't be printing. I'm still using an A7iii, which could be
                        considered old in the mirrorless world, but it's more than enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're shooting video on your mirrorless camera as well then bodies start to matter a bit more. Do you need 10-bit? 4K, 8K? 120fps capability? I'd start to consider an A7RV if I was shooting video as well. It's got far better in-body image stabilization and 4K 60fps.
                        120fps would be nice, but it's not absolutely necessary.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lenses</h2>
                    <p>Now we're getting to the good stuff.</p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a zoom fan (for now). I'm using the Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8 for every shoot. It's such a weird and wonderful lens, big props to Tamron for doing something unique. I can shoot <i>almost</i> an entire car with one lens now. I only keep the Tamron 20-40mm f/2.8 around for the
                        occasional super-wide interior shot, or for doing driving videos.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Filters</h2>
                    <p>Any decent car photography will have at least one, if not two filters in their pack, a circular polarizing and maybe an ND filter.</p>
                    <p>The CPL will enable you to control reflections in paint and glass. Now keep in mind, the CPL isn't magic, it can't fix direct, mid-day sunlight. Understanding light and it's relationship to paint and glass is important. That said, invest in a decent CPL.</p>
                    <p>An ND filter will help when shooting video. You can only reduce your shutter speed so much when filming. An ND filter simply reduces the amount of light coming into the sensor instead of increasing shutter speed.</p>
