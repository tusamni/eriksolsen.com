    short: Erik is very friendly, punctual, and made the outdoors photo session very enjoyable. The photography results were all I could have wanted.
    long: Recently I listed my 1970 Porsche 911T on Hagerty. Upon meeting Erik I was pleased to find an easy to deal with gentleman with an open attitude towards what I was wanting to achieve from the photography of my 911T.  Erik is very friendly, punctual, and made the outdoors photo session very enjoyable. The photography results were all I could have wanted. Erik chose the proper time of day to shoot, positioned my 911T to get the correct depth of field, and I credit Erik with helping me sell my car at full reserve.
