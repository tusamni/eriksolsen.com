title: Sigma Art Ruined Me
description: On a whim I decided to try out a few of Sigma's Art Lenses. Now I have to own one. I'm blown away
excerpt: While I'm very satisfied with my Sony 24-105 G, I had the opportunity to play around with a set of Sigma Art lenses. Despite the size and weight, I love them. It's a series of lenses that sacrifices everything in the pursuit of image quality.

## The Wow Factor

Yep, that's a click-bait title. I rented three Sigma Art and boy am I glad I did. They're stunning for car photography. They've got next level sharpness and at an f-stop of 1.4 an absolutely beautiful DOF for certain shots.

I only have one major complaint with the Art line. They're so good I had to own one. Scratch that, two issues. They're amazing but also giant and heavy.

### What's the harm, you rented. Right?

That's technically true. I used LensRentals.com (plug for an awesome company) to grab three Sigmas:

-   85mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art
-   50mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art
-   24mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art

From the first shot I was hooked. If you're solely concerned with image quality, go for the Sigma's. Outside of the G-Master line there's not much else that competes. Yes, they're absolutely huge and heavy. The 85mm is ridiculous in length and weight, and Sigma makes a 135mm!

It was a sad day when I sealed the box to return them back to LensRentals. I couldn't shake the need for the 50mm. Luckily I was able to work out a deal and got one, no cost to myself.

My greatest concern is the sheer size. They're really not portable at all unless you're only concerned in taking one lens with you. Seeing as I'm shooting cars most of the time, I need to be mobile. But, I'll throw caution to the wind and just enjoy the image quailty for the time being.
