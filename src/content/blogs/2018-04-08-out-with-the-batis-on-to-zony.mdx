excerpt: For the last year or so I've absolutely loved my Batis lenses. However, I think it's time for a change to the Sony Zeiss. The whole point of going mirrorless was to keep size and weight down as much as possible.

## What's a Downgrade

I've owned the A7ii and Batis lenses for just over a year now. Great camera and lens combo, but for some reason I'm finding the itch to go smaller.

I've decided to downgrade (?) to a Zeiss Sonnar T\* 35mm f/2.8. The form factor just can't be beat. I think that I'll be more apt to shoot if I'm not stuck carrying around a few primes. The Zony 35mm still has that Zeiss image and build quality, so I'm hopeful it won't feel like a "downgrade".
