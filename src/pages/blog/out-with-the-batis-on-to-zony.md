excerpt: For the last year or so I've absolutely loved my Batis lenses. However, I think it's time for a change to the Sony Zeiss. The whole point of going mirrorless was to keep size and weight down as much as possible. I'm really liking the design of the Sony Zeiss 35mm f/2.8. The Batis lenses aren't heavy per se, but they can't compare to the 35mm.

## What's a Downgrade

I've owned the A7ii and Batis lenses for just over a year now. Great camera and lens combo, but for some reason I'm finding the itch to go smaller.

I've decided to downgrade (?) to a Zeiss Sonnar T\* 35mm f/2.8. The form factor just can't be beat. I think that I'll be more apt to shoot if I'm not stuck carrying around a few primes. The Zony 35mm still has that Zeiss image and build quality, so I'm hopeful it won't feel like a "downgrade".
