### Greater Goods

Each month, Greater Goods Coffee in Dripping Springs hosts Coffee With Cars. There were plenty of interesting cars there, however, the Dodge Demon really caught my eye.

### Dodge Demon

I was just blown away with how ridiculous this car was. I can't even imagine trying to put down 800hp on the street, even with drag radials. The demon is in all the details. It's a single purpose car and Dodge makes no bones about it. It's got 315 width rear tires for goodness sakes! I'm in love.
