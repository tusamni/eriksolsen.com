It's harder to filter that collection down to one car I may actually be able to own. Without ever driving one, I've always assumed that car to be a Backdraft Cobra.\r\n\r\nFor those that don't know, Backdraft Cobra's are built in South Africa and use a custom built chassis with E36 suspension components mated to a Ford based drivetrain. Engine options are usually a 427 or Mustang Coyote.\r\n\r\nThis example was a beautiful flat gray with black stripes and teal accents. It also had the \"B\" option which adds black accent trim and is my favorite look for a Backdraft. For an engine the owner opted for an Iconic built, Ford Racing 427, absolutely brutal and awesome. It's very close to the exact spec I would use for my own build.\r\n\r\n<Gallery>\r\n    <Grid>\r\n        {frontmatter.gallery.map((i) => (\r\n            <GridImage>\r\n                <Picture src={i} />\r\n            </GridImage>\r\n        ))}\r\n    </Grid>\r\n</Gallery>\r\n";
