    <h2>Digital Marketing</h2>
    <p>
        For fifteen years, I've run digital marketing campaigns. Lately, I've been in charge of revenue growth at ICG America, generating $50 million
        in direct-to-consumer sales.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finding creative ways to combine cutting-edge tools, deep targeting and personalized messaging is what drives me each day at work. It's what
        has allowed me to build, scale and maintain high-performing acquisition campaigns. Whatever the marketing channel, my approach is always the
        same: use a data-driven approach with a dash of automation to quickly scale successful marketing campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently I've created an automated reporting system using Google Sheets and the Analytics & Ads API add-ons. I've also taken our CRO program
        in-house and we're running 3-5 large scale tests each month.
    </p>

    <h2>Other Stuff</h2>
    <p>Outside of work you'll usually find me with my family. I love spending time with them and watching my son grow up.</p>

    <h3>Car Photography</h3>
    <p>
        If I somehow have any free time after that I love shooting pictures of cars around Austin, TX. I'll try and visit <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/CoffeeWithCars/"
            title="Coffee With Cars Dripping Springs">Coffee With Cars</a
        > in Dripping Springs during the warmer months. I also do freelance photography for <a
            href="https://bringatrailer.com/"
            title="Bring a Trailer">Bring a Trailer</a
        > auctions.
    </p>

    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>
        If I can find the time I always enjoy teaching myself new web technologies. Currently I'm relearning SCSS after spending some time with
        Tailwind. I love Tailwind, but plain CSS has become so powerful, it's really fun to be working with it again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Occasionally I'll publish something to GitHub. If you're intersted in the backend, of this site, why not <a
            href={siteConfig.siteRepo}
            title="Astro Portfolio and Blog">check out the repo</a
        >.
