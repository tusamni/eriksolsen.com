                        Finding creative ways to combine cutting-edge tools,
                        deep targeting and personalized messaging is what drives
                        me each day at work. It's what has allowed me to build,
                        scale and maintain high-performing acquisition
                        campaigns. Whatever the marketing channel, my approach
                        is always the same: use a data-driven approach with a
                        dash of automation to quickly scale successful marketing
                        campaigns.

                        Recently I've created an automated reporting system
                        using Google Sheets and the Analytics & Ads API add-ons.
                        I've also taken our CRO program in-house and we're
                        running 3-5 large scale tests each month.
