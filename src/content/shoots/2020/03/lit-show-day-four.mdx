### Petersen Museum

As our trip comes to a close, we made one final trip out to the [Petersen Museum](https://www.petersen.org/). The museum bills itself as "one of the largest automotive collections in the world." They have a rotating collection and what you'll see differs year to year. During our trip they were featuring two major exhibitions, "Supercars: A Century of Spectacle and Speed" and "Hollywood Dream Machines: Vehicles of Science Fiction and Fantasy".

The supercars exhibit was fabulous. Getting to see a GT40 Mk III in person was amazing. Having watched plenty of YouTube shorts on the racing history of the Ford GT, it was fun to finally stand next to one.

### 550 Spyder

That said, the main attraction was the 1956 Porsche 550/1550 RS Spyder. To realize that only 90 of these were made, some were wrecked racing, is pretty chilling. Hagerty claims to know the location of about 80% of the original run, so there's still close to 70 in the wild.

It was a nice way to end the trip. I saw so many incredible current model Porsches on this trip, yet we ended seeing one of the earliest prouction Porsches built. It's a true testament to the longevity of the brand and the passion that still exists in the community today.
