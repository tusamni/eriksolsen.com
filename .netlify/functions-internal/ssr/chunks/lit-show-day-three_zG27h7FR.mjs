COVID was in the early stages and flights were arriving from hotspots across the world. However, none of that mattered when there was a Singer 911, 911R and a 996\r\nGT2 parked out front!\r\n\r\n<Gallery>\r\n    <Grid>\r\n        {frontmatter.gallery.gallery01.map((i) => (\r\n            <GridImage>\r\n                <Picture src={i} />\r\n            </GridImage>\r\n        ))}\r\n    </Grid>\r\n</Gallery>\r\n\r\n## CarParc USA\r\n\r\n[CarParc](https://carparcusa.com/) USA is an interesting place, it's one part Porsche, one part art gallery. The Gulf hot rod up front was amazing. Attention to detail was insane and I would have loved to take that car home with me. I loved the yellow 911S with red houndstooth as well, such a perfect combination of style. CarParc USA had a Celette which was neat to see. There's not too many of those left around.\r\n\r\n<Gallery>\r\n    <Grid>\r\n        {frontmatter.gallery.gallery02.map((i) => (\r\n            <GridImage>\r\n                <Picture src={i} />\r\n            </GridImage>\r\n        ))}\r\n    </Grid>\r\n</Gallery>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Emory Motorsports Open House\r\n\r\nRod Emory is to 356's as Singer is to 911's. They're buying a ton of restoration level 356's and modifiying them for their customers. I love the unique customizations that come out of tuners like this. The obvious star of the show was Emory's shop car, a 356 they modified to have rear mounted twin turbos.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the shop [Gunther Werks](https://www.guntherwerks.com/) brought along a mint green 400R. Absolutely insane.\r\n\r\n<Gallery>\r\n    <Grid>\r\n        {frontmatter.gallery.gallery03.map((i) => (\r\n            <GridImage>\r\n                <Picture src={i} />\r\n            </GridImage>\r\n        ))}\r\n    </Grid>\r\n</Gallery>\r\n\r\n";
