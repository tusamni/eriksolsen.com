I'm more than a bit embarassed to say I've lived in Austin for years and never made it out to COTA. That all changed with an invite to the 2017 US Vintage Nationals. It was awesome to walk around the pits and see vintage F-1 cars idling and pit crews working fervently to get everything up and running.

The highlight was standing on the walkway over turn 3. It was during the classic 911 race. The noise was epic, listening to flat 6's screaming by at full throttle. Sadly, I didn't have my camera with me at the time.
