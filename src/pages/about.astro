                    <p>
                        For fifteen years, I've run digital marketing campaigns. Lately, I've been in charge of revenue growth at ICG America,
                        generating $50 million in direct-to-consumer sales.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finding creative ways to combine cutting-edge tools, deep targeting and personalized messaging is what drives me each day at
                        work. It's what has allowed me to build, scale and maintain high-performing acquisition campaigns. Whatever the marketing
                        channel, my approach is always the same: use a data-driven approach with a dash of automation to quickly scale successful
                        marketing campaigns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently I've created an automated reporting system using Google Sheets and the Analytics & Ads API add-ons. I've also taken
                        our CRO program in-house and we're running 3-5 large scale tests each month.
