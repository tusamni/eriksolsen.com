## Send the Signal

A friend decided to list this gorgeous 911S Targa. It was a car owned by a well known member of the early Porsche community who sadly passed away. My friend was able to purchase this car from his estate with the intention on finishing the car to the standars of the previous owner.

What's not to love about this car: Pepita houndstooth and tan leather interior, targa, "S" and finished in Signal Yellow from the factory. It's an amazing assortment of options, one of my favorite cars in his collection.

This car has yet to make it to Bring a Trailer though. It's still at the shop receiving the final touches. When it does get listed, it's going to the moon.
