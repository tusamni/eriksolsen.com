## COTA Time

I received an invite from a friend to visit Circuit of the Americas during the [2017 U.S. Vintage National Championship](https://svra.com/race-results/2017-u-s-vintage-national-championship/) series. It was the first time I've been to COTA and was obviously blown away. It's new and beautiful. There are amazing race cars left and right. Just a stunning experience.
